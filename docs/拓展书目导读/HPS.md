### 摘录

Chapter 5

At different times and places, there have been appeals to the following reasons
for including a historical component in science programmes:

- History promotes the better comprehension of scientific concepts and
methods. (历史帮助学生更好理解科学概念和方法)

- Historical approaches connect the development of individual thinking
with the development of scientific ideas.(历史将个人的思维发展和人类科学认识的发展过程联系在一起)

- History of science is intrinsically worthwhile. Important episodes in the
history of science and culture should be familiar to all students. (科学史本身就值得了解)

- History is necessary to understand the nature of science. (不了解科学史, 就不了解科学的本质)

- History, by examing the life and times of individual scientists, humanises
the subject matter of science, making it less abstract and more engaging
for students. (了解科学家的生平和时代，让抽象的科学更有人味)

- History allows connections to be made within topics and disciplines of
science, as well as with other academic disciplines; history displays the
integrative and interdependent nature of human achievements. (科学史展现了学科领域之间的联系, 说明人类智力的成就并非各自孤立)
