摘录：
One part of this contribution by HPS is to connect topics in particular scientific disciplines, to connect the disciplines of science with each other, to connect the sciences generally with mathematics, philosophy, literature,
psychology, history, technology, commerce and theology; and finally, to display the interconnections of science and culture – the arts, ethics, religion, politics – more broadly. Science has developed in conjunction with other
disciplines; there has been mutual interdependence. It has also developed, and 
is practised, within a broader cultural and social milieu. These interconnections
and interdependencies can be appropriately explored in science programmes,
from elementary school through to graduate study. The result is far more
satisfying for students than the unconnected topics that constitute most
programmes of school and university science. Courses in the sciences are too
often, as one student remarked, ‘forced marches through unknown country
without time to look sideways’.
