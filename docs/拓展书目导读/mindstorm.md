摘录:

Two fundamental ideas run through this book. The first is that it
is possible to design computers so that learning to communicate
with them can be a natural process, more like learning French by
living in France than like trying to learn it through the unnatural
process of American foreign-language instruction in classrooms.
Second, learning to communicate with a computer may change the
way other learning takes place. The computer can be a mathematics-
speaking and an alphabetic-speaking entity. We are learning
how to make computers with which children love to communicate.
When this communication occurs, children learn mathematics as a
living language. Moreover, mathematical communication and alphabetic
communication are thereby both transformed from the
alien and therefore difficult things they are for most children into
natural and therefore easy ones. The idea of "talking mathematics"
to a computer can be generalized to a view of learning mathematics
in "Mathland"; that is to say, in a context which is to learning
mathematics what living in France is to learning French.

In this book the Mathland metaphor will be used to question
deeply engrained assumptions about human abilities. It is generally
assumed that children cannot learn formal geometry until well into
their school years and that most cannot learn it too well even then.
But we can quickly see that these assumptions are based on extremely 
weak evidence by asking analogous questions about the
ability of children to learn French. If we had to base our opinions
on observation of how poorly children learned French in American
schools, we would have to conclude that most people were incapable
of mastering it. But we know that all normal children would
learn it very easily if they lived in France. My conjecture is that
much of what we now see as too "formal" or "too mathematical"
will be learned just as easily when children grow up in the computer-
rich world of the very near future.
